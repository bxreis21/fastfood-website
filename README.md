# FastFood Website

Hey there!

This website is being developed for the purpose of studying the Django Web Framework, HTML, and CSS.

The website will feature a homepage and a menu that customers can navigate to place orders at the restaurant. Users can add as many items as they wish to their orders.

To facilitate this, the website includes a login and registration system for user accounts. Users can have administrator privileges, which will allow them to create menu items, categorize them, edit them, receive orders, and classify them as "Pending," "Sent," or "Canceled." All these functions will have HTML templates and be styled with CSS, so users can perform these tasks directly on the website (except for granting administrator status to a user, which will be done in Django's admin panel).
